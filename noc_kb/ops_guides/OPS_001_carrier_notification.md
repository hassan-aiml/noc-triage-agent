# Carrier notification procedure

## When to notify a carrier
Notify the carrier for these external alarms:
- EXT-001: No DL input / DL input low at POI
- EXT-002: DL input overdrive at POI
- EXT-003: TDD sync lost from BTS (external source)
- EXT-004: Carrier removed / frequency changed (if not pre-coordinated)
- EXT-005: UL noise rise at POI (notify carrier AND Operations)

## Do NOT notify carrier for internal alarms
INT-001 through INT-012 are our responsibility. Do not involve the carrier unless directed by Operations.

## What to tell the carrier NOC
1. Site name and address
2. DAS system identifier if the carrier has one
3. Alarm name and ID from this KB
4. Time alarm first appeared
5. Current power level reading if available from NMS
6. Impact description — "No downlink coverage in building" or "DL coverage degraded on [bands]"
7. Your name and callback number
