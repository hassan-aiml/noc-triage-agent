# Vendor dispatch guide and standard first-trip kit

## When vendor dispatch is required
Vendor dispatch is authorized by Operations only. NOC does not dispatch directly.

Typical conditions requiring vendor dispatch:
- Remote or hub cannot be resolved by remote reboot
- Fiber LOS confirmed — physical repair required
- VSWR or hardware fault requiring on-site inspection
- Fan or PSU replacement needed
- GPS/sync cable inspection or replacement needed
- Any P1 alarm that Operations cannot resolve remotely within 1 hour

## Vendor contacts

<!-- ============================================================
     DEMO DATA — All vendor company names, contacts, phone numbers,
     and SLA terms below are fictitious placeholders for demo
     purposes. Replace with your actual preferred vendor list
     and their contracted response times before production use.
     ============================================================ -->

### Primary vendor — Apex Field Services
- Dispatch line (24/7): (214) 555-0611
- Email: dispatch@apexfield-demo.com
- Primary contact: Kevin Marsh | (214) 555-0624
- Coverage area: DFW metro, north Texas
- Contracted response: 4 hours for P1, next business day for P2/P3
- Portal: https://dispatch.apexfield-demo.com

### Secondary vendor — NovaTech Wireless Solutions
- Dispatch line (business hours): (972) 555-0732
- After-hours: (972) 555-0745
- Email: service@novatech-demo.com
- Primary contact: Lisa Huang | (972) 555-0758
- Coverage area: DFW metro, south Texas
- Contracted response: 6 hours for P1, 48 hours for P2/P3
- Use when: Apex is unavailable or site is outside their coverage area

### Vendor escalation — Operations Engineer authorizes
If neither vendor can meet P1 response time, Operations Engineer escalates to Operations Manager (Tom Beckett) for alternate vendor authorization.

## Standard first-trip kit — every vendor visit

These are low-cost items. Every vendor truck must carry them on every dispatch regardless of alarm type. The vendor bills us for any materials used. There is no excuse for a failed first-trip resolution due to a missing item from this list.

### Fiber and optical
- Fiber inspection scope with one-click cleaner (most important — cleans fix 50%+ of LOS faults)
- Spare SC/APC jumpers: 1m, 3m, 5m (minimum 2 of each)
- Spare LC/UPC jumpers: 1m, 3m, 5m (minimum 2 of each)
- Spare SFP transceivers: single-mode 1310nm (confirm wavelength before dispatch — check site record)
- Optical power meter

### RF and antenna
- 50-ohm terminator caps — N-type (minimum 10 units)
- 50-ohm terminator caps — DIN 7/16 (minimum 5 units)
- Fixed attenuators — N-type: 3 dB, 6 dB, 10 dB (one of each)
- Torque wrench calibrated for N-connectors (20–25 in-lbs)
- Spare N-type male connectors and short RG-316 jumpers
- Basic VSWR bridge or cable/antenna analyzer

### Power and general
- Assorted fuses — DC and AC (match common hub models in portfolio)
- Multimeter
- PoE tester cable

### GPS and sync
- Spare GPS antenna (patch type, standard — inexpensive, always carry one)
- Spare GPS antenna coax (RG-6 or LMR-195 with appropriate connectors)

### Access and tools
- Laptop with VPN and NMS read access (view-only for field techs)
- Flashlight and head lamp
- Phone with GPS signal strength app to verify sky view at GPS antenna location
- Site access credentials or building management contact info (provided in dispatch work order)

## Scope of work template — Operations fills this out for every dispatch

Operations creates the vendor work order in ServiceNow and includes all of the following. An incomplete work order is returned to Operations before dispatch proceeds.

Required fields in every work order:
1. Site name, full address, and building access instructions
2. Alarm ID and alarm name from this KB
3. Severity (P1 / P2 / P3) and contracted response time
4. Specific remote or hub ID affected (from NMS)
5. What Operations already confirmed remotely — power status, management ping, NMS reading, optical power if available
6. Specific task for the vendor — do not say "investigate"; say "inspect fiber span from HUB-01 port 4 to RU-08, clean connectors, replace if LOS persists"
7. Materials to bring — reference this kit plus any alarm-specific items from the runbook
8. On-site contact (building manager or facilities — name and number)
9. Operations Engineer callback number for vendor questions on site
10. ServiceNow ticket number to log work against

## Dispatch authorization matrix

| Severity | Who can authorize dispatch | ServiceNow approval required |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | On-Call Operations Engineer | No — verbal authorization, log in ticket afterward |
| P2 | On-Call Operations Engineer | Yes — ServiceNow approval workflow |
| P3 | Operations Manager (business hours) | Yes — ServiceNow approval workflow |

---

## Post-dispatch process

After the vendor completes work on site:

1. Vendor submits completed work order with: work performed, materials used, time on site, outcome (resolved / partially resolved / requires follow-up)
2. Operations Engineer confirms alarm cleared in NMS
3. ServiceNow ticket updated with resolution details
4. If first-trip did not resolve — Operations Engineer reviews cause, updates scope, schedules return visit
5. If materials were missing that should have been on the standard kit — log a vendor performance note in ServiceNow

---

## First-trip failure analysis

If a vendor returns from site without resolving the issue, the Operations Engineer must document in ServiceNow:
- What was found on site
- What was attempted
- Why it was not resolved (wrong materials, access denied, fault not reproducible, parts on order, etc.)
- Updated scope of work for the return visit

<!-- ============================================================
     DEMO DATA — Vendor performance tracking thresholds below
     are fictitious estimates. Replace with your actual vendor
     KPI requirements from vendor contracts.
     ============================================================ -->
Target first-trip resolution rate: 80% or higher
Vendors below 70% over 90-day rolling period: escalate to Operations Manager for vendor review
